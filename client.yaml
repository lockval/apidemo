  comment: |
    This example will show you how to read user input and config file and return them to the client
    keywords: **input.Requ, ExcelConfig**
    The config file is main.json, you can display it directly on the button above
    When you execute:
      - npm run serverJsBuildAndUpload
      - npm run serverLuaBuildAndUpload
      - npm run serverStarBuildAndUpload
      - ./serverGoBuildAndUpload.sh
    
    The above script will first upload main.json and then upload the server script
    **Please note**: If you want the config file to take effect, you must change the server code.

  comment:  |
    There are two ways to get all the data
    - **GetSubVal(input.UID, "mList")**
    - **GetSubValAll(input.UID, "mList")**
    
    other api: **DiscardAndUnlock**
    - like **PutAndUnlock**, but does not modify any data
